%----v7.3.0.0 (TPTP version.internal development number)
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----README ... this header provides important meta- and usage information
%----
%----Intended uses of the various parts of the TPTP syntax are explained
%----in the TPTP technical manual, linked from www.tptp.org.
%----
%----Four kinds of separators are used, to indicate different types of rules:
%----  ::= is used for regular grammar rules, for syntactic parsing.
%----  :== is used for semantic grammar rules. These define specific values
%----      that make semantic sense when more general syntactic rules apply.
%----  ::- is used for rules that produce tokens.
%----  ::: is used for rules that define character classes used in the
%----       construction of tokens.
%----
%----White space may occur between any two tokens. White space is not specified
%----in the grammar, but there are some restrictions to ensure that the grammar
%----is compatible with standard Prolog: a <TPTP_file> should be readable with
%----read/1.
%----
%----The syntax of comments is defined by the <comment> rule. Comments may
%----occur between any two tokens, but do not act as white space. Comments
%----will normally be discarded at the lexical level, but may be processed
%----by systems that understand them (e.g., if the system comment convention
%----is followed).
%----
%----Multiple languages are defined. Depending on your need, you can implement 
%----just the one(s) you need. The common rules for atoms, terms, etc, come 
%----after the definitions of the languages, and mostly all needed for all the 
%----languages.
